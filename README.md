## 🎯 Introduction

Scholaric is a learn-to-earn platform that combines education with blockchain technology. Students can participate in quizzes on various subjects, answer questions correctly, and earn cUSD rewards. Teachers and content creators can create quizzes, fund prize pools, and build engaging educational experiences.

The platform uses smart contracts on the Celo blockchain to ensure transparent, fair, and secure reward distribution. All quiz data is stored on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for decentralization and permanence.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Traditional education platforms face several challenges:

1. **Lack of Motivation**: Students often lack financial incentives to engage with educational content
2. **Limited Accessibility**: Quality education is expensive and not accessible to everyone
3. **No Transparency**: Reward systems in traditional platforms are often opaque
4. **High Transaction Costs**: Traditional payment systems charge high fees for small transactions
5. **Geographic Barriers**: Students in developing regions face currency and payment barriers
